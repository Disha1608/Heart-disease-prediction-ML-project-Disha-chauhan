# Heart-disease-prediction-ML-project-Disha-chauhan
Dataset contains 11 clinical features for predicting heart disease events.

This project helps to predict whether the patient has Heart Disease or not. This prediction is made using the clinical data of patients.

age: The person's age in years

sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)

trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)

ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)

thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Based on the application of logistic regression to predict heart disease in our dataset, our model achieved commendable results. 

With an accuracy of [80.49%], precision of [76.86%], recall of [88.57%], and F1-score of [82.30%], our model effectively balanced predictive performance across true positives, true negatives, and error rates. 

The confusion matrix visualization further elucidates our model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases. 

These findings underscore logistic regression's utility in healthcare diagnostics, particularly for early detection and intervention strategies in cardiovascular health.
